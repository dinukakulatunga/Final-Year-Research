# Final-Year-Research
Patient assistive tool with automatic hand-written prescription reader (PatentCare)
MAIN OBJECTIVE
The ultimate goal of the successful implementation of this proposed system will enable the users to scan the handwritten prescriptions, obtain the prescribed medicine information, and maintain patient profile and get notified at the critical stages through warnings.
Main Research Question
The handwriting of doctors is very hard to identify because of their illegible handwriting and usage of abbreviations in medical prescriptions. Doctors use Latin abbreviations and medical terminologies [2] on prescriptions that are not comprehensible by the general persons which make reading it very difficult. Misinterpretation of such prescriptions can cause several kinds of issues due to the lack of readability. According to a recent study by Johns Hopkins, more than 250,000 people in the United States die every year because of medical mistakes, making it the third leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer [1].
Individual Objectives


Scan the medical prescriptions
Major objectives of implementing this proposed research project are recognized in a vast range of specific goals. “PatientCare” will allow the users to scan the handwritten medical prescriptions directly through the mobile application. Character recognition will be performed by the system to detect, segment and to identify the characters from the captured image. Extracted data will be converted into the form of unstructured machine-encoded texts.


Extract the scanned medical prescription information
Machine-encoded texts which exist as unstructured data will be fed to the system as inputs and classified to introduce new categories to medical prescriptions namely medicine name, age and dosage by using concepts of NLP. A set of structured data will be produced as the output of this process.


Extract the medicine information
The structured data are used to identify either generic name or brand name of medicines which are derived from a medical repository. Additionally, it will allow the users to scan blood reports which they could be aware of any possible critical situations by analyzing the reports.


Patient Profile
Finally, patients will be facilitated to maintain their own patient profiles which are capable of storing details about a specific set of personal details along with possible allergies as well side effects. Analyzed results of scanned blood reports will be stored in the system with a gallery of previously scanned prescriptions. If the patients possess a compatible smart wearable device, the system is capable of keeping tracking the heart rate and sleep patterns through the mobile application.
